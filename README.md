# React Tailwindcss Boilerplate build with Vite

This boilerplate is based on an [existing template](https://github.com/joaopaulomoraes/reactjs-vite-tailwindcss-boilerplate) from a [list maintained by Vite's community](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#templates), and has some tiny adjustements.  

The boilerplate is built with Vite, React 18, TypeScript, Vitest, Testing Library, TailwindCSS 3, Eslint and Prettier.
